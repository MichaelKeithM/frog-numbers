# Frog Numbers Practice

Number practice (1-20) for my wife's international KG class. Cursor is a frog.

My wife teaches English as a foreign language to 4-5 year old kids in the middle east. I made this to assist her in teaching her kids the number 1-20. Each number is on a lily pad. When the cursor hovers over a lily pad, the opacity of the lily pad changes to 100% and the cursor is changed to a frog. 

I think this is cute and the kids love it!
